# Fitness Tracker

The task is to review the sample code of the application and you have been tasked with improving the user experience of a mobile app that helps people track their fitness goals. The app has several features, including a step counter, a calorie tracker, and a workout planner.
Your task is to improve the front-end experience of the app and make it more user-friendly. Here are some specific issues to address:
1. The app currently has a cluttered home screen that displays too much information. Users are having trouble finding the features they need.
2. The step counter feature is not prominent enough and users are not using it as often as they should.
3. The calorie tracker feature is difficult to use and requires too many steps to enter information.
4. The workout planner feature is not intuitive and users are having trouble creating and following workout plans.

Your challenge is to address these issues and make improvements to the app's user experience.

# Bonus 
Use your imagination and "document" any features you may feel are neccessary and/or improve the user experience further.
